        "\n",
        "Notice how the blue points are rotated to the red points. This single operation, `np.dot`, transformed our entire dataset. In deep learning, neural network layers perform these kinds of operations on massive datasets to learn complex patterns. Understanding this simple matrix multiplication is key to understanding how information is processed and transformed in an AI model.\n",

        "### The Connection to Machine Learning and AI\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Data Representation:\n",
        "The first step of any machine learning project is to represent data in a way that a computer can understand. In above example, a simple dataset is represented as a matrix called data_points. In a real-world scenario, this matrix could be a table of customer data, a collection of pixel values from an image, or word embeddings from a text document. This demonstrates the core idea that all data, no matter its form, is ultimately a matrix of numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### The \"Model\" as a Transformation:\n",
        "The rotation_matrix is a simplified, fixed-rule version of what a machine learning model actually does. A model's \"learning\" process is all about finding the right values for its own internal matrices (called weights) to perform a desired transformation. In above example, the transformation is a simple rotation. In a neural network, the transformations are far more complex, but they are still achieved through matrix multiplication. The np.dot operation is the engine that drives this process.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### The Goal is a New Representation:\n",
        "The output, transformed_data, is a new representation of the original data. In this specific example, it's just a rotated version. However, in machine learning, this new representation might be a more useful format. For instance, a neural network might transform a matrix of pixel values into a new matrix that represents the \"features\" of the image (e.g., the presence of a nose, a mouth, and eyes). This new, more abstract representation is what allows the model to recognize a face, or make a prediction about an outcome.\n",
